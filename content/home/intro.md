Bringing together researchers from across New Zealand, the Modelling and Future Projections Working Group tackles the scientific questions at the forefront of Antarctic and Southern Ocean research. Using both numerical simulations that are purpose-designed to investigate specific processes, right up to computer models spanning the entire continent or even the whole globe, our team develop and implement the best available tools for understanding how Antarctica will respond as our climate warms. Supported by long-term funding from the [Antarctic Science Platform][platform] and the [NZ SeaRise programme][searise], as well as many other investigator-led grants, the Modelling and Future Projections Working Group contributes model outputs to guide research-based decision making at local, national, and international levels. Explore these pages to find out what our researchers are working on, how to engage with their work, and how to access simulation outputs.
