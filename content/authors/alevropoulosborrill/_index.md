# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research focuses on exploring the future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in response to a changing climate. I have interests in exploring the uncertainties associated with ice sheet model projections as a result of ice sheet model configuration combined with uncertainties in the representation of climate forced processes such as sub-ice shelf basal melting. I use the BISICLES ice sheet model for century scale simulations and am working toward coupling this model to the New Zealand Earth System Model.

interests:
  - Ice Sheet Modelling
  - Sub-ice shelf basal melting
  - Ice-ocean interaction
