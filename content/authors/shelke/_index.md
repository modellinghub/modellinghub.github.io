A Climate enthusiast interested in better understanding of Ocean-Atmosphere interaction processes. I am a former Marie-Curie Fellow worked on the goal of Minamata Convention of United Nations in which, I contributed towards design and development of a Regional Mercury Model to estimate transport of Mercury pollutant for better representation of Ocean-Atmosphere exchange of Mercury. My research interests are inclined towards better representation of Ocean-Atmosphere dynamics in Regional and Global Climate Models under Climate Change Scenarios.
