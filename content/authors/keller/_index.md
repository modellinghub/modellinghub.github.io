My research interests include carbon cycle dynamics and the impact of changes in Antarctica on global climate. Using terrestrial ecosystem models and intermediate-complexity earth system model simulations, I investigate carbon fluxes and environmental change in the present and past warm intervals to understand possible future scenarios.
